# Demonstrates where secrets WOULD appear. All values are sanitized placeholders
# so they don't trip GitHub secret scanning / push protection.
#
# To test the secret detection rules locally, replace the placeholder values with
# realistic tokens (DO NOT COMMIT THEM) and run:
#   yamlguard examples/pod-with-secrets-leak.yaml --rules policies/security/secrets.yaml || true
#
# Placeholders intentionally break the regex patterns used by secret scanning by
# inserting underscores or brackets.
